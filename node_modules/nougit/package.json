  "readme": "Nougit\n======\n\nNougit is **a tasty git client** that runs in your web browser! Who says **sweet** can't be low-calorie? Weighing in at a mere *5mb* uncompressed, it is a lean solution for managing your Git repositories both locally and remotely.\n\n## Prerequistites\n\n* Node.js 0.8.x (http://nodejs.org)\n* Git 1.7.x.x (http://git-scm.com)\n\n> Be sure that you have configured your global git user name and email, otherwise the setup will fail. See http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration for more information.\n\nYou can install the latest stable release via Node Package Manager:\n\n```shell\n$ npm install nougit\n```\n\nOr you can live on the edge and install the latest and greatest with Git:\n\n```shell\n$ git clone https://github.com/gordonwritescode/nougit.git\n```\n\nSince Nougit fills two different roles (acting as a local client or a remote server), it is important to know which role you need it to fill.\n\nSo, where is your Nougit installation going to live?\n\n## Workstation\n\nAs a workstation client, Nougit manages your repositories by default in your home directory under `./nougitrepos`. This is configurable by cracking open `config.json` after running Nougit for the first time. When you are ready to get started, navigate to the directory in your terminal where you have installed Nougit and run:\n\n```shell\nnode nougit/app.js\n```\n\nNougit will do some quick configuration and setup and when it is finished it will listen on port `8080`.\n\n## Server\n\nAs a server, Nougit manages your repositories internally, inside `./public/repositories`. This allows workstations to clone/push/pull the repos over HTTP without requiring additional authentication. **This is not secure if your server is public.** Nougit is intended for internal networks - not public websites.\n\n> Note that when installing with Git, you **must** remove the `.git` directory if you intend on running Nougit as a server. This is because Nougit manages your repositories internally in this mode.\n\nTo run Nougit in server mode:\n\n```shell\n$ node nougit/app.js server\n```\n\n## Contribute\n\nNougit was written to be a specific solution by one developer for him and his team. Want to make it right for you and your team? Please do! Pull requests are always welcome!\n\n## Author\n\nNougit 0.5 by Gordon Hall (gordon@gordonwritescode.com)  \nReleased under MIT license.",
